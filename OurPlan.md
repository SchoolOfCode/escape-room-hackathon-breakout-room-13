<h1>Dreamer Strategy:</h1>

<h2>Space Idea:</h2>
<h3>Story:</h3>
Trying to travel through space to get home, ran out of fuel and crash landed on an alien planet. Complete tasks to get enough fuel / repair ship to move to the next planet.

Different planet for each room
<ul>
    <li>
        Each planet has an individual task or challenge associated with it
    </li>
    <li>
        Aliens are willing to help/ aliens are hostile(same room there's aliens that want to help and other not, discover who is really  helping us)
        On another planet we have limited oxygen. Collect things to be able to breathe.
    </li>
</ul>


<h2>Elementals Idea:</h2>
<h3>Story:</h3>
Natural disasters are causing planetary destruction due to unstable elements. Need to collect each element's crystal until you have them all to restore balance to the world.
Each room will have slightly different challenges associated with that element.

<ul>
    <li>Different element for each room</li>
    <li>
        Each room has a challenge tailored to that element
        Example:
            Water room = riddle in reflection of water
        Earth room = Statues in incorrect places, need to move them to the correct place.
    </li>
</ul>

<h1>Realist Strategy</h1>

<ul>
    <li>
        Firstly, separate roles so there’s no downtime when we’re working.
        Lack of collaboration on scratch means whilst one is building, the other two should be doing something else to help the effort. I.e gathering sprites, theorising the next room.
    </li>
    <li>
        Narrow down project details to make sure we have some value at the end if things get too complicated.
        Example: Room doesn’t have to be themed, we just need a challenge and a reward to get to the next room. (MVP)
    </li>
    <li>
    Make sure to maintain conversation when building/gathering resources to keep each other on the same page.
    </li>
    <li>Make sure to simplify and generalise some assets so they’re reusable across rooms. Don’t get too intricate.</li>
    <li>Work together initially to get on the same page and make sure we’re feeling comfortable trusting each other to work on our own.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Critic Strategy</h1>

<ul>
    <li>Due to time constraints, we’ll ensure that one room is completed with all members understanding the tasks. Have a plan in place for following rules to show others what we plan on achieving with the final outcome.</li>
    <li>Be flexible and anticipate any problems that might occur. If we cannot build what we expect, have a backup solution that will work. For example: unable to add element’s crystals we can replace this with a number</li>
    <li>Make sure that we test what we are building  from the beginning so we know it actually works before moving onto the next steps and get feedback from users from an early stage.</li>
</ul>
